I’ve been working with Microsoft Technologies since [1997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSbBvKaM6sk "Woo Hoo"), including Visual Basic, C++, .NET, Access, SharePoint, and SQL Server. My many years of industry experience is backed by a degree in Computer Science.

I have designed, implemented, and managed OLTP, data warehousing, and OLAP data systems. During these projects, I was able to flex multiple disciplines. From database design, ETL, Power BI, and reporting.

My most recent experience has focused on creating technical content to help get other developers up-to-speed. Recent projects include writing instructor-led content for courses focused on ([SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/sql-training.aspx "I contributed to some courses"), both on-premises and in Azure.

If you’re curious about this blog's tech - here's the breakdown:

- Static HTML managed by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) 
- Source markdown hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/PhilStollery/philstollery.github.io)
- Hosted free on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/pricing/) - this is amazing, push change to GitHub, Netlify runs Jekyll, and publishes changes
- Live CMS editing of posts with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org)
- Theme based on [Daktilo](http://daktilo.github.io) with dark mode swithced on by me
