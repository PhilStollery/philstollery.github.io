I've  been working with Microsoft Technologies since [1997](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSbBvKaM6sk "Woo Hoo"), including Visual Basic, C++, .NET, Access, SharePoint and SQL Server. My many years of industry experience is backed by a degree in Computer Science.

I have been involved in the design, implementation, and management of all types of data platform including OLTP, data warehousing, and OLAP. This includes multiple disciplines including database design, ETL, Power BI, and reporting and using multiple languages including Transact-SQL.

I am also an experienced developer of technical content. Recent projects include writing courses for the [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/sql-training.aspx "I contributed to some courses") both on premis and in Azure.

If you're curious about this blog's tech - here is the breakdown:

- Static HTML managed by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) 
- Source markdown hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/PhilStollery/philstollery.github.io)
- Hosted free on [Netlify](https://netlify.com) - this is amazing, push change to GitHub, Netlify runs Jekyll, and publishes changes
- Live CMS editing of posts with [Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org)
- Theme based on [Daktilo](http://daktilo.github.io) with dark mode swithced on by me
