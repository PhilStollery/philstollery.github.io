Unfortunately due to NDA and other fun things, I can't talk about how all the modules on [microsoft.com/learn](microsoft.com/learn) are made. The other problem is that each module doesn't include any author information. 

What I'm listing here are modules that I have a personal interest in, and might have had a hand in creating :)

- [Protect your virtual machines with Azure Backup](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/protect-virtual-machines-with-azure-backup)
- [Protect your on-premises infrastructure from disasters with Azure Site Recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/protect-on-premises-infrastructure-with-azure-site-recovery/)
- [Choose the appropriate API for Azure Cosmos DB storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/choose-api-for-cosmos-db)
- More to come at [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/browse)
