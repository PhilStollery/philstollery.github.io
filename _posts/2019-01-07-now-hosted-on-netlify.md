When I started this twitter replacement, it was just a way to capture things I was finding whilst working. SQL stuff, Azure stuff, and now static HTML. 

GitHub is my source control repository, push my commits causing Netlify to kick into action and boom, my website is updated. From Push to Build in one commit. 

Isn't technology amazing.
